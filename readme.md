Readme Generator

This project was very similar to the module project so I used it as a guide and template.
Because this was a readme file, i had to do some research in order to get the correct layout. I had some trouble getting the file to get created as I had some issues with the fs part of my code. After some tinkering and refrencinf back to the module project, I figured out I had written my function incorreclly and fixed it. 
My readmefile is a little bland and not styled as some others I have came across but it uses the data taken from the command line and makes a file!

Here is the link to the video showing the functionallity:
